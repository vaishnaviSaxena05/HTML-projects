        <p>"Preservation of cosmic balance requires intervention."
Vishnu role as preserver is evident — he ensures that power does not fall into the wrong hands.
This avatar teaches that sometimes, ethical deception is necessary to uphold a greater moral order.
Conclusion
The Mohini avatar is a unique, symbolic tale about illusion, divine play (Leela), and justice. It reflects how appearances can deceive, and how divine intervention often works in mysterious, unexpected ways. Mohini is not just a tale of enchantment but a metaphor for inner discernment, reminding us to look beyond the superficial to find the truth.</p>

   <h1> The Enchantress of the Gods</h1>
<p >Long ago, the world was in chaos. The gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) both desired Amrita, the nectar of immortality, hidden in the depths of the cosmic ocean. To retrieve it, they joined forces and began the great Samudra Manthan—the churning of the ocean of milk.
As they churned, wondrous treasures emerged—jewels, divine animals, even the goddess Lakshmi. Finally, Dhanvantari, the celestial healer, rose with the pot of Amrita.
Greed surged. The Asuras snatched the pot, refusing to share with the gods. A fierce battle loomed, and the balance of the universe hung by a thread.
The gods turned to Lord Vishnu, the Preserver. Smiling gently, he said, “Sometimes, the sword is not the answer. Let charm be our shield.”
With that, he transformed into Mohini, a woman of such beauty that even the stars paused to admire her. Radiant and graceful, Mohini appeared before the quarrelling Asuras.
“Let me serve the nectar to each of you, fairly and equally,” she said, her voice like music.
The Asuras, enchanted and foolish, agreed without question.
One by one, Mohini served the Amrita—but only to the gods. The Asuras, lost in her beauty, noticed nothing.
But one clever Asura, Swarbhanu, disguised himself as a god and drank a drop. At once, Mohini saw through the trick. With a flash, she hurled the Sudarshana Chakra, severing his head. Yet, the nectar had already touched him. His head and body became Rahu and Ketu, celestial forces that would forever chase the sun and moon, causing eclipses.The gods, now immortal, defeated the Asuras. Balance was restored.
And Mohini? She vanished like a dream, leaving behind a whisper in the wind:
“Not all victories come from war. Some are won with wisdom… and a smile.”</p>
